	automated facial expression recognition ; 	<task> <otherscientificterm>	1 4 1 ; 1 0 1 ; 1 6 1 ; 1 3 1	automated facial expression recognition has received increased attention over the past two decades . existing works in the field usually do not encode either the temporal evolution or the intensity of the observed facial displays . they also fail to jointly model multidimensional -lrb- multi-class -rrb- continuous facial behaviour data ; binary classifiers-one for each target basic-emotion class-are used instead . in this paper , intrinsic topology of multidimensional continuous facial affect data is first modeled by an ordinal man-ifold . this topology is then incorporated into the hidden conditional ordinal random field -lrb- h-corf -rrb- framework for dynamic ordinal regression by constraining h-corf parameters to lie on the ordinal manifold . the resulting model attains simultaneous dynamic recognition and intensity estimation of facial expressions of multiple emotions . to the best of our knowledge , the proposed method is the first one to achieve this on both deliberate as well as spontaneous facial affect data .

	chart-based phrase structure parsing ; natural language ; 	<task> <material> <method>	2 5 2 ; 2 1 2 ; 1 3 0 ; 2 3 2	we present an efficient algorithm for <task_0> of <material_1> that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from unrestricted texts where many of the words are unknown and much of the text is irrelevant to the task . the parser gains algorithmic efficiency through a reduction of its search space . as each new edge is added to the chart , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the edges adjacent to it , rather than all such edges as in conventional treatments . the resulting spanning edges are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which edges are introduced so that every final constituent covers the longest possible span . this is facilitated through the use of phrase boundary heuristics based on the placement of function words , and by heuristic rules that permit certain kinds of phrases to be deduced despite the presence of unknown words . a further reduction in the search space is achieved by using semantic rather than syntactic categories on the terminal and non-terminal edges , thereby reducing the amount of ambiguity and thus the number of edges , since only edges with a valid semantic interpretation are ever introduced .

	real-world data analysis ; identity uncertainty	<task> <task>	1 2 0	identity uncertainty is a pervasive problem in <task_0> . it arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identifiers or when those identifiers may not be perceived perfectly . in such cases , two observations may or may not correspond to the same object . in this paper , we consider the problem in the context of citation matching -- the problem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication . our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to define a generative model for the domain , including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar . <task_1> is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain . inference is based on markov chain monte carlo , augmented with specific methods for generating efficient proposals when the domain contains many objects . results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching . the declarative , relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers .

	oral communication ; 	<material> <task>	1 0 1 ; 1 2 1 ; 1 3 1	oral communication is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document . given the development of storage media and networks one could just record and store a conversation for documentation . the question is , however , how an interesting information piece would be found in a large database . traditional information retrieval techniques use a histogram of keywords as the document representation but oral communication may offer additional indices such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance . an alternative index could be the activity such as discussing , planning , informing , story-telling , etc. . this paper addresses the problem of the automatic detection of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders . several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated : similar to activities one can define subsets of larger database and detect those automatically which is shown on a large database of tv shows . emotions and other indices such as the dominance distribution of speakers might be available on the surface and could be used directly . despite the small size of the databases used some results about the effectiveness of these indices can be obtained .
	hierarchy of phrasal patterns ; dictionary word sense definitions	<method> <otherscientificterm>	0 3 1	this paper shows how <otherscientificterm_1> can be analysed by applying a <method_0> . an experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing definitions from the longman dictionary of contemporary english . a property of this dictionary , exploited by the system , is that it uses a restricted vocabulary in its word sense definitions . the structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the classification of new word senses in terms of the senses of words in the restricted vocabulary . examples illustrating the output generated are presented , and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed . the analysis process applies successively more specific phrasal analysis rules as determined by a hierarchy of patterns in which less specific patterns dominate more specific ones . this ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the definitions are produced when more complete analyses are not possible , resulting in a relatively robust analysis mechanism . thus the work reported addresses two robustness problems faced by current experimental natural language processing systems : coping with an incomplete lexicon and with incomplete knowledge of phrasal constructions .

	global navigation satellite system ; inertial navigation system ; on-line interference effects ; 	<task> <task> <task> <task>	3 6 3 ; 3 1 3 ; 3 3 3 ; 0 0 1	in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm to detect/compensate <task_2> when integrating <task_0> and <task_1> . the gnss/ins coupling is usually performed by an extended kalman filter -lrb- ekf -rrb- which yields an accurate and robust localization . however , interference cause the gnss measurement noise to increase unexpectedly , hence degrade the positioning accuracy . in this context , our contribution is twofold . we first study the impact of the gnss noise inflation on the covariance of the ekf outputs so as to compute a least square estimate of the potential variance jumps . then , this estimation is used in a bayesian test which decides whether interference are corrupting the gnss signal or not . it allows us to estimate their times of occurrence as well . in this way , the impaired measurements can be discarded while their impact on the navigation solution can be compensated . the results show the performance of the proposed approach on simulated data .

	non-rigid structure from motion techniques ; monocular nonrigid 3d reconstruction ; template-based methods	<method> <task> <method>	2 0 0	two main classes of approaches have been studied to perform <task_1> : <method_2> and <method_0> . while the first ones have been applied to reconstruct poorly-textured surfaces , they assume the availability of a 3d shape model prior to reconstruction . by contrast , the second ones do not require such a shape template , but , instead , rely on points being tracked throughout a video sequence , and are thus ill-suited to handle poorly-textured surfaces . in this paper , we introduce a template-free approach to reconstructing a poorly-textured , deformable surface . to this end , we leverage surface isometry and formulate 3d reconstruction as the joint problem of non-rigid image registration and depth estimation . our experiments demonstrate that our approach yields much more accurate 3d reconstructions than state-of-the-art techniques .

	domain-specific word alignment ; alignment adaptation approach ; 	<task> <method> <method>	2 5 2 ; 2 6 2 ; 2 3 2 ; 2 0 2 ; 1 3 0	this paper proposes an <method_1> to improve <task_0> . the basic idea of alignment adaptation is to use out-of-domain corpus to improve in-domain word alignment results . in this paper , we first train two statistical word alignment models with the large-scale out-of-domain corpus and the small-scale in-domain corpus respectively , and then interpolate these two models to improve the domain-specific word alignment . experimental results show that our approach improves domain-specific word alignment in terms of both precision and recall , achieving a relative error rate reduction of 6.56 % as compared with the state-of-the-art technologies .

	people counting in crowded scenes ; regression-based techniques	<task> <method>	1 3 0	regression-based techniques have shown promising results for <task_0> . however , most existing techniques require expensive and laborious data annotation for model training . in this study , we propose to address this problem from three perspectives : -lrb- 1 -rrb- instead of exhaustively annotating every single frame , the most informative frames are selected for annotation automatically and actively . -lrb- 2 -rrb- rather than learning from only labelled data , the abundant unlabelled data are exploited . -lrb- 3 -rrb- labelled data from other scenes are employed to further alleviate the burden for data annotation . all three ideas are implemented in a unified active and semi-supervised regression framework with ability to perform transfer learning , by exploiting the underlying geometric structure of crowd patterns via manifold analysis . extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach .

	text processing software ; spelling-checkers ; 	<task> <task> <otherscientificterm>	2 3 2 ; 1 4 0 ; 2 0 2 ; 2 1 2 ; 2 2 2	spelling-checkers have become an integral part of most <task_0> . from different reasons among which the speed of processing prevails they are usually based on dictionaries of word forms instead of words . this approach is sufficient for languages with little inflection such as english , but fails for highly inflective languages such as czech , russian , slovak or other slavonic languages . we have developed a special method for describing inflection for the purpose of building spelling-checkers for such languages . the speed of the resulting program lies somewhere in the middle of the scale of existing spelling-checkers for english and the main dictionary fits into the standard 360k floppy , whereas the number of recognized word forms exceeds 6 million -lrb- for czech -rrb- . further , a special method has been developed for easy word classification .

	morphologically rich languages ; statistical language modeling	<material> <method>	1 3 0	statistical language modeling remains a challenging <method_1> , in particular for <material_0> . recently , new approaches based on factored language models have been developed to address this problem . these models provide principled ways of including additional conditioning variables other than the preceding words , such as morphological or syntactic features . however , the number of possible choices for model parameters creates a large space of models that can not be searched exhaustively . this paper presents an entirely data-driven model selection procedure based on genetic search , which is shown to outperform both knowledge-based and random selection procedures on two different language modeling tasks -lrb- arabic and turkish -rrb- .
	spoken dialogue systems ; user modeling ; cooperative responses ; 	<task> <method> <otherscientificterm> <method>	1 4 0 ; 1 3 2 ; 3 3 3	we address appropriate <method_1> in order to generate <otherscientificterm_2> to each user in <task_0> . unlike previous studies that focus on user 's knowledge or typical kinds of users , the user model we propose is more comprehensive . specifically , we set up three dimensions of user models : skill level to the system , knowledge level on the target domain and the degree of hastiness . moreover , the models are automatically derived by decision tree learning using real dialogue data collected by the system . we obtained reasonable classification accuracy for all dimensions . dialogue strategies based on the <method_1> are implemented in kyoto city bus information system that has been developed at our laboratory . experimental evaluation shows that the <otherscientificterm_2> adaptive to individual users serve as good guidance for novice users without increasing the dialogue duration for skilled users .

'' to a q&a system , but the text given to the system includes only the description `` x tonnes of petrol was conveyed to japan from saudi arabia '' . we think that the description is a good clue to find the answer for our query , `` x tonnes '' . but there is no large-scale database that provides the associative relationship between `` imported '' and `` conveyed '' . our aim is to develop an <method_1> that can obtain such an associative relationship , which we call scenario consistency . the method we are currently working on uses an expectation-maximization -lrb- em -rrb- based word-clustering algorithm , and we have evaluated the effectiveness of this method using japanese verb phrases .

	boosting methods ;  ; classifiers	<method> <method> <method>	1 5 1 ; 1 2 1 ; 1 6 1 ; 1 3 1	boosting methods are known not to usually overfit training data even as the size of the generated <method_2> becomes large . schapire et al. attempted to explain this phenomenon in terms of the margins the classifier achieves on training examples . later , however , breiman cast serious doubt on this explanation by introducing a boosting algorithm , arc-gv , that can generate a higher margins distribution than adaboost and yet performs worse . in this paper , we take a close look at breiman 's compelling but puzzling results . although we can reproduce his main finding , we find that the poorer performance of arc-gv can be explained by the increased complexity of the base <method_2> it uses , an explanation supported by our experiments and entirely consistent with the margins theory . thus , we find maximizing the margins is desirable , but not necessarily at the expense of other factors , especially base-classifier complexity .

	learning video representation ; 	<task> <otherscientificterm>	1 3 1 ; 1 6 1 ; 1 2 1 ; 1 5 1 ; 1 0 1	learning video representation is not a trivial task , as video is an information-intensive media where each frame does not exist independently . locally , a video frame is visually and semantically similar with its adjacent frames . holistically , a video has its inherent structure -- the correlations among video frames . for example , even the frames far from each other may also hold similar semantics . such context information is therefore important to characterize the intrinsic representation of a video frame . in this paper , we present a novel approach to learn the deep video representation by exploring both local and holistic contexts . specifically , we propose a triplet sampling mechanism to encode the local temporal relationship of adjacent frames based on their deep representations . in addition , we incorporate the graph structure of the video , as a priori , to holistically preserve the inherent correlations among video frames . our approach is fully unsupervised and trained in an end-to-end deep convolutional neu-ral network architecture . by extensive experiments , we show that our learned representation can significantly boost several video recognition tasks -lrb- retrieval , classification , and highlight detection -rrb- over traditional video representations .
